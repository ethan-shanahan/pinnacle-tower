Mr. Shinra is a lucrative businessman and Master of the [[Shinra Manor|Manor]]. He wore a white suit and a gold watch on his left wrist. His stylised, bright orange hair matched his orange eyes. As he descended the stairs, champaign in hand, he began his speech. We were all gathered to celebrate the company's 20 year anniversary. Rufus paid respects to his father, [[records/Shinra Senior]], from whom he had inherited this manor 30 years ago.

His speech was interrupted when the chandelier began to spin and sparkly brilliantly. In that moment of distraction, something attacked Rufus. A bright blue light emanated from behind him before a blue sword impaled his chest. He was dead within seconds, collapsing down the stairs.
