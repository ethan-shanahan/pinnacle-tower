## Clockwork Automagic Soldier Trained in Order Restoration

The history of the warforged race is one filled with mystery and hardship. From their initial creation as simple training tools did evolve the more complex and eventually sentient generations. The challenges warforged faced included exploitation, experimentation, discrimination, and prejudice.Â 

Castor, a brass warforged with a violet core, was created as part of the [[Ignis Kingdom]]'s ambition to build a powerful mechanical army, but a strand of sentience and consciousness was woven into them. Castor's connection with [[Professor Bitterbronze]], an artificer who nurtured their growth, empowers Castor to awaken this sentience and strive for a meaningful existence. Rising to the rank of centurion, they fought valiantly in battles for the Ignis Kingdom. However, when Professor Bitterbronze is captured by the [[Umbrus Kingdom]], Castor is consumed by passion and condemns themselves and their entire century to death in sudden retaliation.

Awakened in the present-day forgotten scrapyards of the Umbrus Kingdom, Castor seeks to uncover the truth behind their mysterious restoration and carries the memory of Bitterbronze as they try to navigate a new path. Guided by their [[Fate Incarnate|Patron]], an enigmatic voice, they set out on a journey to the legendary Pinnacle Tower, with a newfound purpose and determination.
