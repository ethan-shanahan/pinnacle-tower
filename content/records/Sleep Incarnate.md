Sleep Incarnate was the first [[Incarnate]] we encountered. It happened while we were resting after #chapter1. They planned for this meeting a long time ago, and now that our time had come, we were all whisked away into the [[Dreamscape]]. Even [[Castor]], who dreamed that night for the very first time.

They are slender with shock white hair, and wear a long, white gown. Their hands are covered with large black gauntlets, but they also wear a ring with a blue stone embedded. Their eyes are a similar solid blue colour and occasionally glow.

Sleep spoke to us, despite us not being who they expected to meet. They told us that they expected to see some old friends who were present at Sleep's inception. They told us about the Incarnates, describing their strange existence. Strangest of all however, was when Sleep referred to [[Hylaeus]] as [[Hylaeus|Francis]]. They seemed to know a great deal more than we do about the workings of the universe.

Sleep extended an open invitation to the party so that we can visit Sleep in the Dreamscape whenever we wished. Knowing the Castor does not ordinarily sleep, they pull a blue ribbon from the stone of their ring and bequeath it to Castor. If Castor ties it to themselves, they will transport to the dreamscape when others could simply dream.
