He is a middle-aged man in a lab coat with greasy hair and bags under his eyes. In his hand is a glass of ice cubes that don't seem to melt. He looked generally disinterested with the guests at his table. He did come to attention however when we began to discuss the effects of teleportation on [[Sol Gem]]s.
