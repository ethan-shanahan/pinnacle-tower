Jory is a lovely bear person. They are mostly human in appearance, save for the bear ears poking out from a wild mass of black hair and bearish nose. They carry an ornate travelling staff and bear a wide smile on their face.

They can play the fiddle and can duet with [[Castor]].

Jory sold her soul to [[records/Oenanthe Crocata]] (water hemlock) to save her girlfriend.
