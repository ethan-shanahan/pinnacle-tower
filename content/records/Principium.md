The sun shines through the sparsely clouded sky, the sound of conversation and the wheels of carriages fill the air as you all stand in the city centre of Principium. A large statue of the Goddess Fortuna made of polished granite shines in the daylight, her small stature set before the colossal tower ahead. Made of grey brick and eclipsing the sky like a stroke of the sword, [[Pinnacle Tower]] stands before you all.

Principium is a moderate city within the [[Leto Kingdom]].
