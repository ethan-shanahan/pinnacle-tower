Incarnates are rare beings that exist within the world of Pinnacle tower. The come into existence spontaneously and typically have a broad range in how their existence presents. A commonality amongst Incarnates is that they all represent a concept given form and mind. For example Sleep Incarnate has the concept of sleep, the form of a shapeshifter and a generally a timid mindset.

All incarnates posses a host of powers related to the concept they represent. These powers can be shaped by their will to perform whatever effect they desire so long as it is within the range of their concept. Sleep Incarnate can make targets fall to sleep, but they are also able to traverse and control the Dreamscape, a world of dreams. If the effect of a spell would fall under an Incarnates concept, said Incarnate can replicate the spells effect. However be it replicating a spell effect or a totally unique effect, these abilities are not considered magical and thus are not effected by spells such as counterspell, antimagic field and dispell magic.

Incarnates, whether to make their powers easier to use or let others use their powers, can create what is called an Aspect. An Aspect is a portion of the Incarnates power, split off from themselves and shaped into the desired form of that incarnate. For example, Sleep Incarnate has an Aspect that is a blade tipped spear. This spear is capable of making its struck targets very drowsy and lethargic. In this way, Sleep doesn't have to focus on applying this effect intentionally with their powers raw. Incarnates can summon and dismiss their Aspects at will, sending them into a non-existant state when dismissed. However while an Aspect is summoned, the Incarnate who owns said Aspect cannot call use that power raw. ie: If sleep has their spear exist, they cannot point at someone and apply the spears effect from range. An Incarnate cannot dismiss an aspect however, if they create their Aspect as a living being.

When an Incarnate dies, all existing Aspects become Relics. A Relic forever houses the power that was placed within the Aspect but otherwise functions the same as before the Incarnates death. Additionally, when an incarnate dies their form collapses into what is called a Seed. A Seed holds all the power an Incarnate had before it died, excluding any power split into Aspects.
