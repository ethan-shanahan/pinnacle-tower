Nif is the chief of the goblin village called [[Try bel|Try'bel]]. They speak Common, but calls it Great One Speech. Nif was happy to help the party help the forest, seeing them as Great Ones. He directed us to the [[Great Tree]] where a plague of some kind had taken root. Nif also told us about a legendary [[Power Gem|Fallen Star]] that was very important to the goblin people long ago.

Upon the party's final departure from his village, Nif gifted the finest artefact from their artisans: an intricately carved, white flute.
