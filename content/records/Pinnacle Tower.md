Located in the city of [[Principium]], the Pinnacle Tower is an infamous monument of our world. It extends indefinitely high into the sky and is a beacon for adventurers seeking out the unknown. Mages claim that an almighty source of magical power seems to originate from the top of the tower, but of course, the top has never been reached from the outside. Many have entered the tower, but none have returned. The city council has set up a strict bureaucratic system to protect themselves from public outcry as more and more people disappear forever into the tower. Now, everyone who enters must sign off on a contract and is given a small boon to help them on their way.

The tower is built with plain grey bricks, and inside is not much different. While the outside is featureless all the way up, doorways are placed on the inside of the walls. One doorway is at the ground level, while the others rise up the tower with seemingly no way to reach them. In the middle of the floor is a construct named [[Dux]], and at the edge is an empty chest.

[[Dux]] explains the terms of the tower. We enter as challengers and must venture into new worlds to retrieve [[Power Gem]]s. Inside the tower serves as a haven for us to rest and prepare. We have 500 years to complete the challenge, after which Dux will treat us as intruders.
