# Features of the Kampaign

3. FEATS ARE ALLOWED (can be found on 5e tools)  
4. COMBAT MAPS  
5. Legendary actions (wtf)  
6. Lair action (big effect that involves the area that you’re in)  
7. Milestone system for levelling up (based on experiences)  
8. Time is fucky wucky uwu

# Stats

- Kam actually knows how to roll stats now
- Rolling for stats: 4d6s, put lowest number aside, add three together for one stat and repeat for other stats
- Point by system: all stats start off with 8, then split 27 points between stats, costs extra points at 14 and 15
- Rolling a d20: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

And the stat calculations begin...

Kill Kam?

Religious conflicts

Race Stats, backgrounds, language talk, skill modifiers

**50 FEET OF SILK ROPE**

# Worldbuilding

## General

- HOW BIG IS THE TOWER???
- The World of Materia – 3 different kingdoms
- Kingdom of Leto (humans and elves, diversity), City of Light, big trading city Principium (where the tower is) (busy boy)
- Ignis Kingdom – dwarves, warforged, volcano, Western
- Kingdom of Umbrus – Eastern, desert land, sparse animal folk, drow, human population, SHADY KINGDOM, ENTRANCE TO THE UNDERDARK MAYBE: drow, driders, spider things, Olivia’s biggest fear
- The Great Forest (South) – fey, animals and stuff
- Swamp is on the border of The Great Forest and the ocean
- South of Great Forest \= ocean (with sea monsters and merfolk)
- Merfolk split between two cultures – city (higher class) and bandit-y raiding ships type merfolk (anti-magic attitude)

## History

- 20 years ago: war between Ignis and Umbrus
- Building of tensions
- Went on for 6 years or so ish
- Kingdom of Leto intervened with introduction of most recent generation of Warforged (soldier of light SOL)
- SOL (one guy) (might be hot (for a warforged)) (mostly humanoid) (golden wings) (might be single) descended upon battlefield and simply ceased the fighting, forcing negotiations to occur

## Social

### Warforged

- Some respect growing for them due to their part in the war
- Becoming more and more accepted
- Kingdom of Leto: warforged are both revered but it’s based on stereotypes
- Umbrus kingdom doesn’t like warforged
- There are warforged slurs ☹

### Shifters

- group of individuals that exist within tribes that travel around the world
- They have an altar in the desert of Umbrus and in the Great Forest
- History with Ignis (50 years ago there was enslavement of the beastfolk)
- Following the revolution, a leader stood out (lionbeast – Ura)
- Ura came to power in Leto and led all the tribes united and freed all shifters in Ignis Kingdom
- Ker’an – can shift into a roc (hot) (wanted) (scoundrel)

## Pinnacle Tower

- Existed for ages
- Cylindrical
- Nobody’s ever reached the top
- Most difficult dungeon in the world
- Nobody has ever come out
- Somewhere at the top there is a very strong power (wish-granting object)
- NATURAL LIGHT?????? ROOM TO FROLIC?????
- “The tower will supply us with endless enjoyment.” – Ethan
- “And there will be frolicking.” - Kam

## Incarnates

- Concepts given life and form, power associated can be quite strong
- Incarnate power cannot be counter-spelled (their power is not magic)
- Is there an incarnate for every concept? No
- All incarnates can be killed, but this does not remove the concept from the world
- CIARÁN MY BABY BOY (did not die) (deathless)
- Sleep Incarnate – Our previous interaction is no longer canon (lime green tube top)
- Azof: perfection incarnate
- Vasania: Insanity incarnate (Picasso painting)
- They all have a mind and a physical form (randomised)
- They can all transform into a bird (except Bird Incarnate)
- Cold Incarnate: Penguin
- When killed, they become a seed (orb-like object that contains all their power) (you can use their power with this)
- Most of them don’t know any magic at all, but the ones that do only have one spell slot of each level, also take longer to recover spell slots
- We should probably try to kill them all
- KAM SAYS: “YOU HAVE TO EARN THE SEED.”
- Also: “make a death saving throw.”
- Knowledge Incarnate bird form \= owl (probably lol)
