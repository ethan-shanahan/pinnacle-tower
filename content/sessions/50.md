# Pinnacle Tower

The party begins their long rest.

Traian and Castor create an illusory campfire and everyone gathers around to share stories.
Castor shares their memories of Professor Bitterbronze and how they died.
Traian asks Sphyrna and Entacmaea if they have similar tales.
Sphyrna doesn’t remember her birth family, but has since found a family, in her spirit beads.
Entacmaea was banished from her original home.
Castor asks Entacmaea if she has thought more on her wish for the tower.
Entacmaea’s friend has a son. She thought she could help him with her wish.
Traian asks what the others think of the differences in Dux, and what it might mean.
Castor is happy that Dux is happy. Then they implore Traian to share something of himself.

Traian had a sad episode, about a decade ago, when his uncle, Bogdan, was hit by a poisoned arrow on his way home. They used to share recipes and perform experiments together.
Traian wasn’t able to cure the poison before he perished.
Castor senses that Traian is obfuscating.

“But enough of all that gloom.” Traian quickly moves on.
