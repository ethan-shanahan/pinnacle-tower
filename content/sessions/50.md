# Pinnacle Tower

* The party begins their long rest.  
* **Traian** and **Castor** create an illusory campfire and everyone gathers around to share stories.  
* **Castor** shares their memories of **Professor Bitterbronze** and how they died.  
* **Traian** asks **Sphyrna** and **Entacmaea** if they have similar tales.  
* **Sphyrna** doesn’t remember her birth family, but has since found a family, in her spirit beads.  
* **Entacmaea** was banished from her original home.  
* **Castor** asks **Entacmaea** if she has thought more on her wish for the tower.  
* **Entacmaea’s** friend has a son. She thought she could help him with her wish.  
* **Traian** asks what the others think of the differences in **Dux**, and what it might mean.  
* **Castor** is happy that **Dux** is happy. Then they implore **Traian** to share something of himself.  
* **Traian** had a sad episode, about a decade ago, when his uncle, **Bogdan**, was hit by a poisoned arrow on his way home. They used to share recipes and perform experiments together.  
* **Traian** wasn’t able to cure the poison before he perished.  
* **Castor** senses that **Traian** is obfuscating.  
* “But enough of all that gloom.” **Traian** quickly moves on.  
* “Have I told you the story of the stolen wine casket?”  
  * **Traian** tells the tale of  when a knight hired him and others to search for a stolen wine casket. This was way back when he wasn’t so good at alchemy.  
  * Their investigations lead them all over the place before they eventually discovered that the knight himself had drunk the entire casket the night prior.  
  * He grew so drunk that he completely forgot that it was he himself to blame.  
* “I have raided and sunk many ships.” **Entacmaea** butts in abruptly.  
* So, **Entacmaea** was a pirate.  
* **Sphyrna** is curious.  
* **Traian** is nervous.  
* “Did you target the navy?” inquires **Traian**.  
* **Entacmaea** shrugs.  
* **Sphyrna** remembers that attacks of merfolk raiders were common in the south-eastern sea.  
* **Sphyrna’s** eyes go wide in admiration and wonder.  
* **Traian** has encountered a green hag.  
* Conversation draws to a close and we agree to pay **Sleep** a visit tonight.

# The Dreamscape

* A spruce tree stands atop the hill.  
* **Sleep** is not wearing his gauntlets. They are set aside on the grass.  
* Oddly shaped scars are visible along his forearms.  
* **Traian** asks about time, to which **Sleep** responds with a terribly confusing explanation.  
* It’s weird in the dreamscape, and let’s leave it at that.  
* **Sleep** can only partially perceive the party’s adventures.  
* As if watching a silent movie, or reading the cliffnotes.  
* **Sleep** asks if we want to see something different in the **Dreamscape**.  
* **Traian** asks for a creek.  
* In a wave of his arm, the terrain shifts before our eyes, allowing a stream to form next to us.  
* **Sphyrna** asks **Sleep** for his input on her curse issue and takes out her vase.  
* The sky dims in response and **Sleep** quickly asks her to put it away.  
* **Sleep** waves the clouds away.  
* Since the party is not physically here, but merely projecting their consciousnesses, it concerns **Sleep** deeply that just the thought of taking out an object should cause such upheaval in his realm.  
* **Sphyrna** describes the vase and the entities that lurk within.  
* **Sleep** is quiet in contemplation for a while.  
* **Sleep** hasn’t met any of these incarnates.  
* He believes there is no **Rage Incarnate**.  
* If there is a **Forgetfulness Incarnate**, it might be staying hidden.  
* **Azure** does exist and is about, however. It was discussed by the council.  
* It was determined that despite being powerful, she is not acting against the council’s wishes.  
* **Sphyrna** says the rage one definitely exists, but it could instead be bloodlust.  
* A **Bloodlust Incarnate** is known about but does not exist.  
* They were part of a prophecy, potentially coming into existence one day.  
* **Life Incarnate** is no longer with us and we don’t have access to the life seed.  
* **Sleep** wants to ask **Doctri** or **Night Incarnate** to help.  
* For now that is all we can do.  
* We each rest in the evergreen glade of the **Dreamscape**.

# Pinnacle Tower

* After waking up, the party deliberate over the multitudinous pros and cons of the various ***Power Gems*** and their diverse permutations.  
* **Sphyrna** is content with a big sword.  
* **Entacmaea** takes the newfound ***PG Magician***.  
* **Traian** fuses the ***PG Rejuvenation*** with ***PG Copycat***, taking the newly fused ***PG Lively Copy***.  
* **Castor** welcomes a couple of **Weeny Warforged** onto their shoulders.  
* **Entacmaea** deploys her umbrella preemptively, heeding **Doctri’s** warning.  
* With all of us ready to go, **Dux** opens the door wishing us “Best of luck.”

# City of No Stars

* The party finds themself in a dim alleyway.  
* The buildings on either side look odd to us though.  
* The walls are a dark painted metal and have large panels of glass seamlessly embedded in them.  
* Most stunningly about the buildings, however, is their enormous height.  
* Staring up at them induces a throbbing vertigo, but we also notice the dark and starless sky.  
* To our left, the alley ends with a wire fence, beyond which are large green boxes holding refuse.  
* **Entacmaea** and **Sphyrna** notice through the smell of garbage, a scent more rotten from the bins.  
* To our right, the alley stretches out onto a larger road drenched in light.  
* The alleyway is quiet, but noises can be heard in the distance.  
* A slight drizzle starts to fall.  
* We leave the alley and find a neon bathed city crowding around us.  
* Swarms of people shuffle along the street’s sides.  
* Hulking metallic contraptions traverse its centre.

### 14:00

* **Castor** assesses their internal clock. After determining the time to be precisely 14:00, a foreign tone is emitted along with a message in their head. **Castor** recites it for the party.  
* **“WARNING: SYSTEM MESSAGE: 4 INCARNATES IN VICINITY. CAUTION IS ADVISED.”**  
* Suddenly weary, the party starts looking around more closely.  
* There’s a New J Look.  
* There’s a Jdunnes.  
* There is an 8-twelve.  
* There’s a Pjenneys.  
* **Castor** spots a muscular individual, 5’9”, sleeveless denim hoodie. He has a tattoo on his neck.  
* We follow this person before we eventually start to attract attention.  
* The man sees us and turns into a building.  
* It appears to be a shop of shops. How odd.  
* There are moving staircases!  
* We find a **Costaj** and learn that 70% of all shop names are spelled with a J.  
* Naturally we stand in line.  
* A “**Karen**” wants to speak to the manager.  
* **Entacmaea** places our order.  
* The barista has red hair, is 5’5”, wears a uniform, looks tired and blushes when **Entacmaea** rises into the air to speak with her. Her name tag says **Colette**.  
* It turns out that they don’t accept gold as currency here.  
* **Colette** suggests we find a bank.  
* **Sphyrna** thinks we might have more luck at a pawn shop.  
* **Traian** is set on finding the wizard who must surely be in charge of this wondrous place.  
* **Castor** addresses the patrons of **Costaj**, asking about any sightings of falling stars.  
* **Castor** is ignored.  
* **Sphyrna** steals a cupcake for **Entacmaea** and leaves behind a silver coin in the commotion.  
* A gaunt man in his 40’s. \[ok sorry I am totally blanking on what this was about\]  
* We may have defeated the **Fire Lord, Immix**, but we have yet to face the **ICE Lord, Immigration and Customs Enforcement**.

# Reminders

* Don’t forget about the Weeny Warforged.  
* Bank, jewellery, pawn shop, drugs.
